## 🚀 How to Deploy

### Option 1: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)
1. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Deploy to GitHub Pages"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to repository Settings → Pages
   - Source: Deploy from a branch
   - Branch: `gh-pages` (created by GitHub Actions)
   - Save

3. **Access your site**:
   - URL: `https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name`

### Option 2: Manual Deployment
1. **Build the site**:
   ```bash
   # Windows
   deploy.bat
   
   # Or manually
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Upload to GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to repository Settings → Pages
   - Source: Deploy from a branch
   - Branch: `main` / `master`
   - Folder: `/ (root)`
   - Save

## 🧪 Testing Locally

```bash
# Build the site
npm run build

# Serve locally
cd dist
python -m http.server 8000

# Visit http://localhost:8000
```

## 🔧 Backend Integration

The Flask backend is still available for full functionality:

```bash
# Run the Flask app locally
cd apps/web
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

**Note**: GitHub Pages only supports static sites, so the full AI functionality requires running the Flask app locally or on a different hosting platform.

## 📚 Documentation

- `README-GitHub-Pages.md` - Complete setup guide
- `SETUP-GitHub-Pages.md` - Step-by-step deployment instructions
- `DEPLOYMENT-SUMMARY.md` - This summary

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Deploy to GitHub Pages** using the instructions above
2. **Test the site** to ensure everything works
3. **Customize content** as needed
4. **Add more pages** if required
5. **Set up custom domain** (optional)

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Site not updating**: Check GitHub Actions workflow status
2. **404 errors**: Verify all HTML files are in the root directory
3. **CSS not loading**: Check that static files are copied to dist/
4. **Navigation not working**: Verify router.js is in the correct location

### Getting Help
- Check GitHub Actions logs for deployment errors
- Verify all files are present in the `dist/` directory
- Test the site locally before deploying

## 🎉 Success!

Your Glosentra site is now ready for GitHub Pages deployment! The static site will showcase your computer vision platform with a professional, modern interface that works perfectly on GitHub Pages.

The Flask backend remains available for full AI functionality when running locally or on other hosting platforms.
